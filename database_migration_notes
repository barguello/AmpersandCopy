In order to get the model from a mysql diagram do the following:
1. make sure you have the desired diagram
2. delete the ampersand database and create a fresh one
3. sync the diagram with the database
4. run production.utils.populate_core_database.py from the django shell
   *In order to do this, just do the following:
   import production.utils
